# Road Accident Severity Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes road accident severity in India using real-world data. The goal is to identify key factors contributing to severe accidents and provide insights for better road safety.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from [Kaggle: Road Accident Severity in India](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/) and includes:

- Accident time and location
- Road and weather conditions
- Severity levels (Slight, Serious, Fatal)

## Project Steps

1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the dataset and handling missing values.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and trends.
3. **Feature Encoding**: Preparing categorical variables for modeling.
4. **Modeling & Evaluation**: Building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Key Insights

- Accident severity increases during late-night hours.
- Poor lighting contribute to higher risks.
- Lane-changing violations and undivided roads are major contributors to accidents.
